# lambda-utility

  

I love to use the cloud GPU from lambdalab(https://lambdalabs.com/) to start my work of ML and AI.

But unfortunately everytime when you finish your task, you have to **terminate** the instance so that it will not conitnue billing.

  

So next time when you re-allocate a new instance you may need to redo everything to make the environment ready.

  

That is how I start to get the idea to build this project to help myself. It is totally for my **own** convience, so feel freet to modify as you wish.

  

To run the script, just type the following into the bash

  

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stelee410/lambda-utility/main/initial.sh | bash



  

Peace!
